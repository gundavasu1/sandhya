Q)what datatypes are there other than string, number, boolean, any
A)null, undefined

Q)explain null datatype
A)let x : null = null
null data means, there is no data and no memory allocation to the variable

Q)explain undefined datatype
A)let x : undefined = undefined
undefined data means, there is default data.
for number: 0
for boolean : false
for string : empty

Q)explain 
let x : boolean = null
let y : string = undefined

A)
let x : boolean = null
no memory is allocated to x, but telling it is of type boolean

let y : string = undefined
memory is allocated to y, but telling it is of type string. So default value will be there.

Q)what is the output of below code
let x : number
x=10
x=6
console.log(x)
A)6

Q)what is Array
A)To store multiple values
way 1:
let varName : number [] = [1,2,3,4,5]
way 2:
let varName : Array<number> = [1,2,3,4,5]

Q)Can we store mixed datatype in array
A)Yes
let person = ['RSK', 42, true]

Q)Can you write a mixed datatype array including datatype
A) let x : [string, number, boolean] = ['RSK', 10, false]
Good way of coding is, writing the datatype first, then values

Q)what is enum
A)giving user defined names to set of numbers

Q)what is the output
enum Color{Red, Blue, Green, Yellow}
let y:Color = Color.Green
console.log(y)
A)2
It will assign series of numbers starting from 0

Q)what is the output
enum Color{Red=100, Blue, Green, Yellow}
let y:Color = Color.Green
console.log(y)
A)102
Usually it will start with 0 if we don't give a number
But here we are assigning a number for the first one

Q)what is the output
enum Color{Red, Blue=100, Green, Yellow}
let y:Color = Color.Red
console.log(y)
A)0
It will consider 0 from starting
And takes the number whatever we assign explicitly.

Q)what is the output
enum Color{Red, Blue=100, Green, Yellow}
let y:Color = Color.Green
console.log(y)
A)101
we have to increment after we assign explicitly
