class to view
---------------
interpolation : 
property binding : 
class binding : 
style binding :

view to class
---------------- 
event binding :

Q)what is two-way data binding
A)view to class & class to view
ngModel

Q)what is the name of the folder when we use the command "ng g c components\pBinding"
A)we are creating the component "pBinding" under components folder
angular will use only small letters. That's why it converts camel case to hiphen
selector also follows the same. 

Q)what is the folder name, selector and class when we try to create a component using "ng g c components\pBinding"
A)src/app :- p-binding
selector : app-p-binding
class : PBindingComponent

Q)what is the difference between attribute and property
A)consider
<input type="text" value="RSK Helpline"></input>
Here input is the tag
type and value are attributes
Also properties

attribute value won't get changed, whereas property value gets changed

Q)How can we know programatically attribute is not changing and property is changing
A)
create a text field 
<input type='text' value='RSK'>
inspect the text field in UI --> Developer tools will get opened --> open console window --> 
type 
if we consider as attribute
$0.getAttribute('value') 
output : RSK

if we consider as property
$0.value
output : RSK

if we change the value to 'update' in UI
Then 
$0.getAttribute('value') 
output : RSK

$0.value
output : update

That is, we are dealing with DOM values but not attribute values.

Q)what is property binding
A)binding the data with DOM value instead of attribute value

Q)explain property binding i.e., class property to html field
A)we have property in class file
we are assigning that value to text field with the help of class's property

p-binding.component.html
<input type="text" value="{{myName}}">

p-binding.component.ts
export class PBindingComponent {
  public myName='Satish'
}

Note:- if we try to check using dev tools, we will get 
null for $0.getAttribute('value')
myName data for $0.value

Q)explain property binding using square brackets
A)
p-binding.component.html
---------------------------
<input [value]="myName">

p-binding.component.ts
---------------------------
export class PBindingComponent {
  public myName='Satish'
}
