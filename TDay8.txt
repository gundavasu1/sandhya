Q)is it good practice to point to jquery javascript or install
A)install is better

point:
we can copy the link in jquery website and mention in index.html. But we may face versioning issues in the future.

install:
cmd>yourApp>npm install jquery --save
Then installed files will get loaded into appName/node_modules folder
Then we have to update in angular.json --> build obj --> styles[] scripts[]

eg:
"styles": [
  "src/styles.css",
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
],
"scripts": [
  "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"
]

Q)if we install more than one framework like bootstrap and jquery, then bootstrap may not work, why?
A)we will mention both the javascript frameworks in scripts array of build obj
if we mention bootstrap first, then jquery
Then if there is any same name in both frameworks, then the second one will replace the first one. In these cases, bootstrap may not work as expected. That's why we have to load as per our requirement 

Q)Can we install more than one framework at a time
A)yes
eg:npm install framework1 framework2 --save
we just need to use space in between each framework

Q)which framework is better to learn bootstrap or angular material
A)angular material. because all the projects are moving from bootstrap to angular

A)ng add @angular/material
Then it will check our installed angular application version and installs the compatible angular/material version.
