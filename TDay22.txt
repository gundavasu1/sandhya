Q)what is the use of using suggestions while writing code
A)auto import of required classes

Q)what if we don't choose routing while creating the application
A)just get the skeleton of app-routing.module.ts file in internet
and mention the module in app.module.ts

Q)what is base href
A)It is present in index.html i.e., forward slash
we don't need to write the forward slash after http://localhost:4200

Q)what is routing
A)It allows us to naviate to which component we like.
we will configure all the paths in routes array of app-routing.module.ts

Q)explain <router-outlet></router-outlet>
A)It should be present in app.component.html

Q)How to configure routes in angular application
A)
step 1:
app.component.html
<router-outlet></router-outlet>

step 2:
we have configure all our required routes in const array of app-routing.module.ts
const routes: Routes = const routes: Routes = [
	{
		path: '',
		redirectTo: '/home', //url redirect to other 
		pathMatch: 'full'
	},
	{
		path: 'if',
		component: IfComponent //http://localhost:4200/if
	},
	{
		path: 'switch',
		component: SwitchComponent //http://localhost:4200/switch
	},
	{
		path: 'home',
		component: TestComponent //http://localhost:4200/test
	},
	{
		path: '**',
		component: PageNotFoundComponent //http://localhost:4200/pageNotFound
	}
];

explaination:
-> whenever we try to run the application using http://localhost:4200, it tries to load the app component
-> Then it displays all the configured components in app.component.html
-> Here we have mentioned the tag <router-outlet></router-outlet>
-> Then control knows that user has configured a list of components in the routes array of app-routing.module.ts
-> Then however we request in the browser, that url will get executed from top to botton of routes array
-> if we provide the url http://localhost:4200
Then it matches the path: ''
Then it found redirect url
Then it tries to find redirect url in the const array and executes
-> we have to put the default path '**' at the end as every url will matches and our application fails

Note:-
we gave path as 'home', but configured component as "TestComponent". Its upto us to put whatever the path we want.
