Q)Explain the flow of angular application
A)
step :
control goes to main.ts
step :
control can understand which module to get loaded by using bootstrap i.e., AppModule
step :
Then control goes to app.module.ts where it can understand the bootstrap component is AppComponent
step :
Then control goes to the components typescript i.e., app.component.ts. Here it can understand the template file, css file, selector
step :
Then it checks where this selector is used
step :
It can be found in the app-root selector in index.html
step :
Then whatever we mention in app.component.html will get displayed in browser
Since we mentioned <app-root> tag in index.html, control will find the corresponding html file (app.component.html) of this tag by using typescript file i.e., app.component.ts

In simple way, we will place our custom components in app.component.html 
Then they were displayed accordingly

Q)How do we call the files ts, css, html, spec
A)ts : class file
html : view file
spec : test file
css : style file

Q)In how many ways we can call our components in app.component.html
A)three ways

way1: as custom element
selector as tag

selector: 'app-test'
<app-test></app-test>

way2: as class property value for any element
selector: '.app-test'
<div class="app-test"></div>
Note:- we kept a dot in front of selector

way3: as property of an element
selector: '[app-test]'
<div app-test></div>
Note:- we have enclosed the selector in square brackets.
