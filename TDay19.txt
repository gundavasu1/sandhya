html:
<h2>for structural directive</h2>
<h3 *ngFor="let x of emp | keyvalue">

</h3>

ts:
export class ForComponent {
 public emp = {
  id: 1,
  name: "srini",
  age : 43

}

explanation:
we have to use the keyword "keyvalue" to get key and value of each property of our object
Then only we can use "key" and "value" 

output:
age--43
id--1
name--srini
