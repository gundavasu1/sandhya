we can run the typescript file as

Q)what is export{} 
A)usually nodejs considers each typescript file as separate module. we cannot use these variables in other modules.  
vscode will show error if we don't write the line export{}, because the variables can't be used outside.

Q)what is watch option
A)Usually we have to compile the typescript file for each time we make modifications
if we add watch option while compiling, we don't need to recompile for each modification
i.e., terminal>tsc fileName --watch
Then nodejs will keep track of modifications and applies to javascript file immediately
