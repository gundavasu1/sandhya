Q)From Angular 13/14 onwards, strict mode is true by default. How can you make as false
A)tsconfig.json --> make false wherever you see x+strict+x
In the same way, do in angular.json file

Q)Can we have children to some component
A)Yes
Usually we will mention all the paths in app-routing.module.ts file
Here we will have another property called children 

eg:

{
	path: 'courseDetails/:id',
	component: SelectedCourseComponent,
	children:[
		{
			general way
		},
		{
		}
	]
}
