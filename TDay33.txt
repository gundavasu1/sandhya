Q)How to use parameters even after rendering the component i.e., when reusing the component
A)consider we have a component. where we are displaying the currentCourse details
consider there are two buttons called "Previous" and "Next"

First Time Only
this._activatedRoute.snapshot.paramMap.get('id')

Reusing
this._activatedRoute.paramMap.subscribe(params: ParamMap) => {
	params.get('id');
})'

Here we are using the subscribe method, so whenever there is any change in the url parameters, we will get the new ones without any issue.
