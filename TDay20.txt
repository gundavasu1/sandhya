A)when two components are interacting with each other. 

Q)explain parent to child interation
A)consider app component is parent component
and child is child component

parent will pull the message in a cover and send to child. cover is nothing but property binding

app.component.ts
public parentMsg='This message is from parent'

app.component.html
<app-child [cover]="parentMsg"></app-child> 

child.component.ts
@Input() cover:string

child.component.html
{{cover}}

explanation:- 
@Input() tells that this is not your typescript message, but it is from your parent
