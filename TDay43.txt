Q)what is Multicasting Observable
A)It is a process where we want to share an Observable across components
The component will get the data according to the time that it make a request.

Q)Difference between Multicasting Observable and individual Observable
A)consider we have two components A & B

with individual Observable:-
----------------------------
each component will subscribe to a service. Then service will provide the Observable back to component
Here we will create separate instances to the same service in each component
consider the service is emitting data as 1,2,3,4,5
consider A did subscribe, then it get data 1,2,3
Then B did subscribe, then it get data 1,2,3 (it will get from starting)

with Multicasting Observable:-
-------------------------------
Here we will have same instance to the service for all of subscribed components
consider A did subscribe, then it get data 1,2,3
Then B did subscribe, then it get whatever A is getting from now onwardsi.e., 4,5 but not 1,2,3,4,5
