Q)what is absolute url
A)if the url start with forward slash, then it is absolute url

Q)what is the issue with absolute url
A)whenever there is a requirement to change the url 
If we just change the url in routing module, then it may not work. Because we need to change in all the components wherever we are using.

Q)How relative url overcomes the url change issue
A)Usually we will do with absolute path as

myMethod(){
	this._router.navigate(['/courseDetails', {id: this.courseId}]);
}

we have to use activatedRoute in case of relative url i.e.,
this._router.navigate([{id: this.courseId}, {relativeTo: this._activatedRoute});

Note:-In absolute path, we will mention the url first, then we will write parameters
But in relative path, we will mention parameters first, then url using activatedRoute
