Q)How to save all files at a time vscode ide
A)ctrl + shift + s

Q)what is style binding
A)applying the style to a tag through typescript property
eg:
html:
<h2 [style.color]="myColor">Hello World</h2>

ts:
export class SBindingComponent {
 public myColor='blue'
}

Q)Difference between class binding and style binding
A)in class binding, we will provide the css to the html tag using 3 files i.e., html, ts and css 
But in style binding, we will do the same with 2 files i.e., html, ts

Q)whats the difference between inline styles vs classes
A)The point of CSS is to separate the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS). It's all about accessibility and code reuse.
If we use class, we can reuse that again and again because it has to see css
If we use style, we cannot reuse as it presents inline of html tag

Q)Can we provide style binding using single files
A)yes
<h2 [style.color]="'blue'">Hello World</h2>
Note:- 
->Here we are giving the value to style instead of property name, so control hasn't need to go to typescript
->To provide value directly, we have to put in single quotes
->But we have to put double quotes for property values in html file
->That's why we are using single quotes inside double quotes i.e. "''"

Q)write a program to provide font-size using style binding to a tag
A)Usually we can do like below
<h2 [style.color]="'blue'">Hello World</h2>

so, replacing color with font-size i.e., 
<h2 [style.font-size]="'blue'">Hello World</h2>
But it won't work.
Because we should not use hiphens. Instead we can use camel case 

so,
<h2 [style.fontSize]="'blue'">Hello World</h2>

Q)wap to use style font-size binding conditionally
A)
html:
<h2 [style.fontSize]="myRequired ? '30px' : '80px'">Hello World</h2>

ts:
export class SBindingComponent {
 public myRequired=true
}

explanation:-
Here we are using ternary operator i.e., <condition> ? trueStatement : falseStatement

Q)How to apply group style
A)
html:
<h2 [ngStyle]="myStyleGroup">Hello World</h2>

ts:
export class SBindingComponent {
 
 public myStyleGroup={
  
  color:'red',
  fontSize:'50px',
  fontStyle:'italic',
  fontWeight:'bold'
 
 }
}

Note:- Here we are using ngStyle instead of style. 
even style works, but it is good practice to use ngStyle
